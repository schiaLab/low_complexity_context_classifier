# low_complexity_context_classifier

This program had been developed for evaluate some hypothesis I have, the possiblity of useful amount of hash-relationship between alphabet frequency and the context of the words.
In the repository, I put my pdf slide of the study. 

I might update the program to evaluate more than fake news, and hopefully enhance the accuracy as high as my mathematical estimation says or other notable natural language process alogorithms.

You need to download the dataset from Kaggle, because of potential copyright issues, just to be safe for you and me. Put the dataset files unmodified into the "data" directory.
