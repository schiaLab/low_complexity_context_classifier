# low_complexity_context_classifier

This program had been developed for evaluate some hypothesis I might have, the possiblity of useful amount of hash-relationship between alphabet frequency and the context of the words.
In the repository, I put my pdf slide of the study. 

I might update the program to evaluate more than fake news, and hopefully enhance the accuracy as high as my mathematical estimation says.
If you are interested of this research, feel free to contact me.
